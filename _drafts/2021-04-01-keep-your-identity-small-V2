Paul Graham wrote this great article in 2009: http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html

I'm probably a bit out of my depth in discussing such things, however it may promote thought none the less.

This idea that as soon as people discuss something that is part of their identity becomes a fruitless discussion is an interesting one but I think it can be taken further.

- People think in binary most of the time -> categorising other people around them and themselves
