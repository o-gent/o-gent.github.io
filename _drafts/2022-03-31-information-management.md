* * *

I have a pretty big problem with information management and I think most of the planet does too. I normally have 10+ browser windows open across multiple desktops each with 5-20ish tabs. A lot of the time these tabs are almost instantly in-active, I probably won't use the tab except see it and remember why it's there. Yes, yes, bookmarks I hear you say - I try to collate as many things into the Microsoft Edge (i hate microsoft too but i have my reasons) "Collections" folders, which are pretty useful and I do find myself going back through them every so often. This still doesn't feel like enough and I still end up leaving tabs open. Another example of how I store information would be through spreadsheets, for university projects I have lists of products we have purchased and I often come back to these to look up spec sheets etc. But what do I do with items which I maybe want to buy? I could have another list I suppose.. or leave that tab open..

Firstly, I think I need to look at why anyone would leave tabs open in the first place. For me, this is due to wanting to remember the content in the page - save it for later. I know that I'll forget it. That moment when you open a page and you find something that you're looking for or something which lights the spark of curiosity, you want to keep it forever. Sometimes you can use that information straight away - you're looking for specific figures and you can put those into a report etc. Usually you'd want to file this source. Another more unusual time is when you're exploring the internet, clicking through links and reading through reams of information until something clicks, you know it's important but you don't know what to do with it right now.

I think for me, favorites / collections / excel aren't intuitive enough to find information in. Leaving the tab page open doesn't help of course, but this lack of good storage method is at the back of my mind making me reluctant to expend effort. Information in our heads is stored so vaguely, lots of impressions cross linked together - some of which we can't even explain (I certainly struggle to explain reasons for something using words). Therefore, categorising ideas into folders doesn't work, they don't neatly fit into one folder. Often when I'm looking for something in "collections" I'll expect it to be in one folder but it's in another which seemed more appropriate at the time. Searching doesn't really work for me, often I don't know the name of the company I'm looking for, I just know somebody does something cool and I've seen it (among other impressions).

I have looked at other platforms, Pinterest is a classic which does seem to work reasonably well for images. However this does seem to still be category based, siloing ideas and thoughts. Also what if I want to store links? what if I want to store locations? what if i wanted to store a link with an associated location which is related to architecture, planes and spoons all at the same time? 

Ideally we'd have neural interfaces to machines which can just solidify our current memory - if we never forgot things then we wouldn't need to store them externally (for personal use). However, we are stuck with looking at screens for now.

## some thoughts on company data storage

From experience working with a large company (and from university projects), this problem becomes even more exaggerated. Now you potentially have thousands of people storing information, and wanting to access information all from each other. All thinking in their own different ways of where something should be stored and how it should be stored as well as not necessarily caring. In the case of leading university projects, it was far more painful than I imagined just to get people to store information on our shared network drive, let alone store it in a useful way. Thinking about it, we had the same problem at the company too - people would often save to their local drive - apparently not considering their work may be useful for the wider company. 

As a slight side thought -> Excel is both a blessing and a curse in that you can format information in any way you want and it's easy access, anyone can use excel. Made even worse in that formulas etc are hidden, mistakes are not obvious, change history is limited (I could go on). Trying to understand someone elses spreadsheet can be an absolute nightmare, every person has their own style whether this is thought through or not.  

Another problem is platform diversity, at the company I worked at we had multiple ways of storing files, multiple data platforms which usually overlapped and multiple "admin" type platforms in various shades of 2005. Different teams stored things differently, different sections of the company had different platforms. On a small scale, what's the big deal? if everyone can do their jobs and be happy doing things there own way, why restrict people? Unfortunately, my job regularly required navigating back through work other people had done and regularly accessing different systems to get data for new projects. Often finding out where information was stored was a task in itself and had to be done through conversation and hopeful emails to find the right person. There was no "homepage" for the company - info was scattered across the aether and not a single person understood the full picture. 

Alright maybe my team was a specific case, but does data storage also have an impact on most teams who usually have small width data relevancy? yes I think so. I don't think it's possible to operate efficiently without being able to understand learning from previous work or draw experience from other teams. The new starter penalty is also potentially massive, they've got to figure out what's going on to do their job and also figure out your data system.

We're all searching through the dark with a dim head torch at the moment.

## conclusion

what's the solution? I have a bunch of impressions of what I want but it needs to be made. It's got to store many media forms with fluid categories and these categories / ideas need to be navigated fluidly.

Although, right now without any new tools being developed, companies and employees need to rethink how important storing their information is. It should be vital to any company to have a consistent data storage policy because at the moment it is certainly reducing your efficiency.
