I'm studying Aerospace Engineering and I'm interested in engineering, all things computer-y, design and I think applying technology to reduce human impact on the planet is cool. My "specialist" area is UAVs but mostly because these push electronics, programming, structures etc to the limits. 

This is a blog to document personal projects and thoughts.
