WIP

This is a look into which 3d printers are currently available, from ~£500 up to the £10k mark. So not hobby grade but also not for use in industrial products.

There are a lot of features to consider in 3d printing but the core attributes off the top of my head are:
- Technology: Fused Deposition Moulding (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) to name the most popular, in that order. Each have their own advantage, around cost, quality, speed and faff. 
  - SLA resins are (all of them?) toxic so require careful handling until the parts are cured. They also require washing / curing process on top of the printing process

- Print volume: standard hobby grade FDM printers have volumes 220x220x250mm. FDM printers tend to have the largest build volumes for the same price.
- Multi extrusion/material: currently for FDM , some printers may be able to switch between materials or extrude different colours at the same time.
- Precision: layer thickness & dimensional accuracy
- Networked: can you request prints over the network
- enclosed build volume: useful for printing toxic substances, may have HEPA filters etc
- leveling: auto levelling systems should improve print reliability
- available materials: may be limited to an ecosystem or limited by machine max temperatures and other features 
- extruder type: for FDM, direct drive is generally seen as more desirable
- and many others!

The companies considered: 
- https://formlabs.com
  - Have technical material options
  - expensive but good ecosystem
  - SLA mainly but SLS options at 30K+
