        About
    </h2>

    <p>
        I'm studying Aerospace Engineering and I'm interested in a lot of technology as well as Design. My "specialist" area is UAVs but mostly because these push electronics, programming, structures etc to the limits. This is a blog to document personal projects and thoughts.
